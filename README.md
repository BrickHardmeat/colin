## About
Colin is a fork of the project designed to provide XMLTV data for UK free-to-air TV channels and radio stations for personal use.  This version should contain a week's worth of data although support for the "RT" Television network had to be removed as it kept giving me all sorts of errors that even AI couldn't figure out !

My coding skills are rudimentary at BEST so I employed the services of Perplexity AI to help me make the changes needed.

## Usage
Grab the XMLTV file from this link and paste it into your favorite IPTV client:
